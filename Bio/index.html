    <H3>Who?</H3>
    <p>
        Currently an undergraduate double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. If that statement is still there after Spring 2021, either I lost drive to updating this site, or something went horribly horribly wrong. <br><br>I'm passionate about robotics and embedded hardware/software. I occasionally mentor high school robotics teams and volunteer at robotics events as I greatly benefitted from those programs. I work on a huge variety of projects in my free time, and if I'm doing my job, you can find articles on those elsewhere on the site (work in progress).

    <H3>Where?</H3>
    <p>
        I'm from the great city of Huntsville, Alabama. Also known as Rocket City USA, Huntsville is home to a huge number of engineering firms (and cows). Of note are Marshall Space Flight Center and the Space and Rocket Center, one of which I suggest as a tourist attraction and the other only if you enjoy landmines. I currently live in Auburn Alabama while attending Auburn University(Shocker, I know).

    <H3>Why?</H3>
    <p>
        I do this site for the sake of documentation and because I've benefitted from so many similar blogs over the years. Having straightforward examples can be invaluable to new makers. Also I have found writing these articles forces me to understand/remember what I actually did.

    <H3>What?</H3>
    <p>
        Anything and everything I find interesting enough to write an article on goes here. I don't know what to put here, just including this section for the fulfillment of the fill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws">5 Ws</a>

    <H3>How?</H3>
    <p>
        This content is brought to you by <a href="/projects/Web%20Server/">this monstrosity</a>, a keyboard, and some random text editor (ok fine it's vscode, don't flame me).</p>

    <H3>Professional Experience</H3>
    <p>
        I can't be bothered to duplicate my resume here, so just look at it <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>.
