    <H3>Introduction</H3>
    <p>
        For reference, <a href="manual.pdf">here</a> is the lab manual that was followed. Essentially this lab just introduces the bench equipment to be used in the rest of this lab. Getting used to this equipment is essential for reasonable completion speeds of labs in the future.
        <br><br>
        The lab consists of generating signals on the function generator and measuring them on the oscope and utilizing various fancy features of the oscope like spectrum analysis.
        <br><br>
        The oscope is a <a href="https://www.tek.com/datasheet/mixed-domain-oscilloscopes">Tektronix MDO3032</a>. It can be bought for the low low price of $3,660 (It's probably worth it, I'm just a cheapskate).<br> <image style="border-radius: 8px; padding: 5px; width: 200px;" src="oscope.png"/>

        The fgen is a <a href="https://www.tek.com/arbitrary-function-generator/afg1000-arbitrary-function-generator">Tektronix AFG1062</a>. Sporting up to 60 MHz bandwidth and a a very nice modulation interface with a huge range of options, this hot piece of test equipment definitely gets my thumbs up. I need to find a use of a 1 uHz output, what do you even use a period of about 11.5 days for?  <br> <image style="border-radius: 8px; padding: 5px; width: 200px;" src="fgen.png"/>
